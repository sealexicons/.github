
# Southeast Asia Lexicons (`sealexicons`) Project

This project aims to provide a web service (`sealex-api`) and a user interface (`sealex-ui`) for deployment
on a Kubernetes cluster that provides lexical and related linguistic information for multiple languages found
in Southeast Asia, including:

* Tagalog
* Vietnamese
* Waray

Other languages of interest to the project authors may be added in the future.
